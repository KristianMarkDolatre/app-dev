## Plot
Middle-aged chauffeur Seong Gi-hun lives with his mother in perpetual poverty, knee-deep in debt from a failed business venture and a serious gambling addiction, and struggling to support his daughter after a divorce. One day after missing a train, a sharply-dressed man approaches Gi-hun and offers him â‚©100,000 if he wins a game of ddakji, getting slapped across the face every time he loses. After Gi-hun takes up the offer and wins a few games, the man then gives him a card and invites him to play similar games with much more at stake.

Eventually accepting the offer, Gi-hun wakes up in an unknown location alongside 455 other people, each given a tracksuit and a number, and all of them monitored by masked guards in pink suits who answer to a mysterious man, also masked, known only as the Front Man. It is explained that all 456 people have unpayable debts, but are being given a chance to free themselves from their dire straits once and for all by playing six children's games over the course of six days, after which they are either eliminated or the winner of a grand prize of billions of won.

However, it isn't until the first game is underway that it's made clear what exactly was meant by "eliminating" players. As Gi-hun finds allies and enemies in others amid the physical and psychological twists of the game, several outside variables, including a police officer with a missing brother determined to bring those behind the game to justice, introduce unforeseen complications that threaten to throw the game into chaos.

## Trivia
- It is said that the original title of the show was 'Round 6', referring to the final round of the games. Brazil is the only country which the original title of the series was kept as Round 6.
- Squid Game was originally supposed to be a movie. However, a decision was made to turn it into a series instead, allowing several things to be added and extended, such as the subplot featuring Hwang Jun-ho and In-ho, which did not exist in the original script.
- Netflix edited a few scenes to remove phone numbers on the back of the Squid Games invitation cards. These scenes were edited after finding out the phone numbers were in use by real people who were getting thousands of phone calls from viewers of the series, who were curious to find out about the numbers.
- Several of the actors had previously worked with Hwang Dong-hyuk, such as Lee Byung-hun, Kim Joo-ryoung, and Heo Sung-tae.
